# Forensic Investigations

This section contains selected digital forensic case studies focused on reconstructing system behavior from incomplete, fragmented, and adversarial data sources.

Rather than relying on isolated artifacts, these investigations emphasize building structured models of events through timeline reconstruction, artifact correlation, and evidence-based reasoning.

Each case demonstrates an end-to-end investigative workflow, from identifying relevant artifacts to synthesizing findings into clear, defensible conclusions that support decision making.
