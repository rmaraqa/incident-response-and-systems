Case Overview

This case involved a multi-device digital forensic investigation centered on determining the origin and movement of illicit material across two personal computers and a USB device.

The investigation required correlating artifacts across systems to distinguish between direct user activity and third-party remote access.

Investigative Focus

- Cross-system timeline reconstruction
- USB device analysis and partition recovery
- Identification of remote access tooling and persistence
- Correlation of file metadata with user activity and external control

Approach

The investigation followed a structured methodology:
- Validation of forensic images and integrity via hashing
- Analysis of file system artifacts and hidden storage
- Examination of execution artifacts and remote access logs
- Correlation of email communications with system-level events
- Timeline synthesis to model system behavior over time

Key Findings

- Evidence of a USB-delivered executable masquerading as a system update
- Establishment of remote access sessions following execution
- Consistent file hashes across multiple devices

Skills Demonstrated

- Multi-source artifact correlation
- Timeline-driven forensic reasoning
- Remote access and persistence analysis
