Case Overview

This case involved an insider threat investigation focused on determining whether a trusted employee intentionally accessed and attempted to exfiltrate sensitive information without authorization.The investigation required reconstructing user intent and behavior through correlated technical artifacts rather than relying on a single indicator of compromise.

Investigative Focus

- Insider threat detection and attribution
- Timeline reconstruction of user actions across devices
- Correlation of access patterns, file activity, and communications
- Differentiating benign user behavior from malicious intent

Approach

The investigation followed a structured, evidence-driven methodology:
- Identification and validation of relevant forensic artifacts
- Correlation of file system activity, application usage, and access logs
- Timeline synthesis to model user behavior over time
- Evaluation of technical evidence within organizational and contextual constraints

Key Findings

- Repeated access to restricted data outside of normal workflow patterns
- Artifact consistency supporting intentional rather than accidental behavior
- Temporal alignment between user actions and attempted data movement
- Absence of system-level compromise indicating insider-driven activity

Skills Demonstrated

- Insider threat analysis
- Behavioral modeling from forensic artifacts
- Timeline-driven reasoning
- Evidence-based attribution under ambiguity
