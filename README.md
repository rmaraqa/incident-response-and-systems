# Digital Forensics & Systems Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains selected forensic investigations and systems engineering projects focused on reconstructing behavior, modeling complex environments, and supporting decision-making under uncertainty.

My work spans digital forensic analysis, incident response, and applied systems engineering, with an emphasis on turning fragmented data into structured models that enable confident conclusions and action.

## Repository Structure

### Forensic Investigations
End-to-end digital forensic casework involving timeline reconstruction, artifact correlation, and behavioral analysis across compromised systems.

###  Systems Engineering
Applied projects involving physical and infrastructure systems, including robotics and network architecture design.

###  Supplemental Work
Additional cybersecurity projects demonstrating technical breadth.
