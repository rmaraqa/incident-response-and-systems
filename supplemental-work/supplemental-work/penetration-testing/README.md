Project Overview

This project involved a structured penetration testing assessment conducted in a controlled environment to evaluate the security posture of multiple vulnerable systems.The goal was to identify exploitable weaknesses, demonstrate potential impact, and propose mitigations from a defender’s perspective.

Assessment Scope

- External attack surface evaluation
- Vulnerability discovery through scanning and enumeration
- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in legacy systems
- Privilege escalation and post-exploitation analysis

Approach

The assessment followed a professional penetration testing methodology:
- Reconnaissance and service enumeration
- Vulnerability identification using version and configuration analysis
- Controlled exploitation to validate real-world risk
- Documentation of impact and remediation recommendations

All testing was conducted ethically within an isolated lab environment.

Key Skills Demonstrated

- Offensive security fundamentals
- Vulnerability analysis and exploitation
- Privilege escalation reasoning
- Risk-focused security reporting
- Translation of technical findings into actionable mitigations
